before_action: Used to run specific code before a controller action is executed.

skip_before_action: Allows skipping specific before actions on certain controller actions.

around_action: A callback that wraps around controller actions, enabling code to run before and after the action.

request and response objects: Handle HTTP request data (params, headers, etc.) and the response output (status, body, etc.).

explore CSRF token: Learn about Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection and how the token helps in preventing malicious requests.

initializer: A piece of code that runs during the boot process of a Rails app, useful for setting up configurations or libraries.

explore streaming: Explore how streaming works in Rails, which allows for sending data incrementally to the client.

Error Handling
rescue from / raise: Understand the rescue from pattern for handling exceptions, and raise for triggering errors.

Routing
resource routing: Define standard routes for a resource (like index, show, create, etc.).
controller Namespace and routing: Group controllers under namespaces to organize routes better.
explore shallow: Shallow routing generates only the necessary routes for nested resources, reducing clutter.

Non-resourceful routes: Custom routes that donâ€™t follow RESTful conventions.
explore members and collection: Define custom actions on a resource (using member for actions on individual items and collection for actions on the whole collection).
