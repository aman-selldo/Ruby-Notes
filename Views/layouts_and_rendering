Creating response in rails controller

There are 3 types of primary ways to create http request 

1. render (renders new page without sending request to new url)
2. redirect_to (send the request to different url) (302 found )
3. head (sends only http headers with no body)

redirect_back :- Sends user to pervious page.
rediect_to (do not halt the execution.)
if you want to stop the execution we can use return.


Using head to send headers as a response.
